# CS3307-Command-GUI
 A very simple GUI which takes command line commands and displays output.
 There are working commands such as:
    ls -al
    pwd
    date
    ps
    w
An example of a command that doesn't work is: cd

To run the program first run qmake "CommandGUI.pro".
Then build using "make".
Finally, run the program using "./CommandGUI".
